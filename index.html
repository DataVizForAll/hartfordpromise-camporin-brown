          <h2>Introduction</h2>

          <p class="lead">Have you ever wondered about the challenges faced by students grappling with financial hurdles on their educational path? and what percentage of these students complete their associate's degree at 2-year colleges? The content question we aim to address is this: “At each 2-year college (with at least 5 students who started), what percentage of Hartford Promise students who there, successfully completed with an associates degree?” It's a question that carries significant implications for our community partners, who are: The Hartford Promise Organization. HP is committed to providing high-quality education for students in Hartford. Their goal is to reduce the impact of luck on success by ensuring that every Promise scholar has access to essential resources. It is important to acknowledge that this data will be looked at by The Hartford Promise and then used to get a better understanding of what institutions their students will flourish at as individuals and as an academic. It is our pleasure to be working with such a heartfelt organization like Hartford Promise, that cares so much about their students and only wants what is best for them. As we further delve deeper into the analysis of the data, it is vital to define the term “HP students” as students facing high costs and potential financial challenges during their educational journey. In our research, we have identified variation in the performance of students under Hartford Promise at each school, indicating that students thrive in distinct programs unique to their institutions.</p>

          <p class="lead">TELL AND SHOW your data story and visualizations. Notice how this paragraph appears in a larger font than others, because the HTML code begins with a "lead" class.</p>

          <p>Compose your data story in your Google Doc, because it's easier to write and edit, especially when working with other people. When you're ready, go to this <a href="https://github.com/DataVizForAll/dataviz-story-template">GitHub dataviz-story-template repo</a> to create your own version, and publish it online using Settings > Pages. When your version is published, copy and paste the link into your README file so you can easily click it.</p>

          <p>Everyone must demonstrate their ability to create their own sample version for the quiz. Later, if two people are working together to co-author one data story, you may wish to create ONE GitHub account that both of you can access. But only one person at a time can make edits.</p>

          <p>In your GitHub copy of this template, open the `index.html` file to see how everything must be written in HTML format. Click the pencil symbol in GithHub to edit the file. HINT: In the upper-right corner, switch the dropdown menu from `No Wrap` to `Soft Wrap` to easily view long segments of code in your screen.</p>

          <p>Paragraphs like this one must begin with a `p` tag and end with a `p` closing tag.</p>

          <p>Links must begin and end with `a` anchor tags, with the web address inside either single or double quotes. If you need guidance, check out this <a href='https:/hartfordpromise.org'>Hartford Promise</a>.

          <h2>Findings</h2>
          <p>Let’s begin with the big picture. We examined a total of 254 students who were a part of HP.  While about half of those earned a 4-year bachelor’s degree, we focused on a subset of 108 students who enrolled in 2-year colleges, but we focused on 11 students who received an associates degree from the 2-year college.
Analyzing the data provided by HP and compiled by US CollegeScorecard. The data shows that Manchester Community College showcases the highest number of graduates at 10, surpassing Capital Community College with 7 graduates and Tunxis Community College with 1.
	There is a noticeable variance between the Hartford Promise (HP) and aggregate graduation percentages for each institution, which implies differing success rates among specific students. Manchester Community College stands out as the highest graduation rate at 21%. However, it is worth noting that the sample size Hartford Promise has provided us only includes a total of eleven students.

          <h2>Methods</h2>
          <p>Our data is drawn from a masked data file sourced from Hartford Promise. The data includes information on students from the 2016 and 2017 cohorts, meaning they began receiving tuition support from Hartford Promise in 2016 or 2017. Our data parameters required us to focus on the students in 2-year programs, a total of 108 students from the two cohorts. In order to ensure a usable sample size, we only included schools that met the minimum threshold requirement of 5 students, yielding us a study of three colleges. Using pivot tables and formulaic logic through google sheets, we were able to break down the broader dataset into the information required under our parameters.
	As discussed prior, low sample size is a major restriction of the data. Traditionally, a minimum of 30 values is required to deem a sample representative. Despite the small sample size, this data is aimed to provide insight into what the true trends are within Hartford Promise students at 2-year programs. In order to optimize the data, similar analyses must be undertaken with future cohorts in order to ascertain the true nature of the observable trends.

          <p>Below are sample sentences with MLA inline citations that would appear in the body of the data story, followed by the full references that would appear in the bibliography at the bottom:</p>

          <h4>Sample sentences</h4>

          <p>The City of Hartford recently created a housing code that requires the registration of the full names and contact information for all owners of apartment buildings -- including the officers of Limited Liability Corporations (LLCs) -- in order to "close municipal loopholes that allow anonymous slumlords to operate unchecked" (Lurye).</p>

          <p>In most towns, the percentage of high-needs students enrolled in traditional public schools surpasses those enrolled in magnet, charter, and technical schools in the most recent academic year (“Resident Town Export”).</p>

          <p>...later, insert a bibliography at the end of your data story:</p>

          <h4>Works Cited:</h4>

          <p>Lurye, Rebecca. “New Housing Code in Hartford Would Keep Slumlords from Hiding Behind LLCs.” Hartford Courant, May 31, 2019. <a href='https://www.courant.com/community/hartford/hc-news-hartford-housing-code-20190531-hcke2jo2x5fpdgz75xf4hlv2ki-story.html'>https://www.courant.com/community/hartford/hc-news-hartford-housing-code-20190531-hcke2jo2x5fpdgz75xf4hlv2ki-story.html</a>.</p>

          <p>Optional Hint: To display a clickable web link in the bibliography, look at the HTML code in GitHub for the examples above. See how the URL appears twice: once in the "href" and again in the display text. This is not required for your data story, but it looks good and helps readers to click and view your sources.</p>

          <h2>Sources: Advanced Tips</h2>

          <p>Change names of `Section 1` etc. to customized navigation labels that make sense for your data story, such as `Why It Matters` or `How We Made This` etc. To do this you must change names in TWO places: see the Navigation Container (around lines 30-50) and the corresponding Sections below. Keep the section numbers but change the reader-friendly labels.</p>

          <h4>Optional Subheaders: Use H4 tags to break up long sections</h4>

          <p>All of your data visualizations should be interactive. But if you need to insert a static image, you can upload a JPG or PNG to the GitHub repo, and insert it using the HTML img tag as shown below:</p>

          <img src="sample-image.jpg" style="width: 100%; margin: 30px 0">

          <p>Figure 2: Describe your image in a caption, and always credit the source if someone else created it.</p>

          <h4>Quickly Edit and View Changes on Your Local Computer</h4>

          <p>HINT: Instead of slowly making edits on GitHub, you can quickly make edits in your local computer and view them instantly in your browser. Here's a list of steps (in HTML format):
            <ol>
              <li>Go to your GitHub repo and select Code > Download Zip and uncompress the folder.</li>
              <li>Install a free code editor tool. My fav is <a href="https://atom.io">Atom Editor</a> but there are others, too.</li>
              <li>Open the "index.html" file with your code editor and make edits.</li>
              <li>In your browser, go to File > Open to view the "index.html" file that is on your local computer.</li>
              <li>After making some edits in the "index.html" file, save it, and refresh your browser to view changes. Most edits should appear right away.</li>
              <li>After making multiple edits on your local computer, carefully copy and paste the contents of "index.html" in your online GitHub account, and test your published updates online.
            </ol>
          </p>

          <h4>Two Options for Tables</h4>

          <p>If you need to create a table, first try the Datawrapper Tables tool -- see <a href='https://handsondataviz.org/table.html'>HODV Chapter 8</a> -- and embed the results like this:</p>

          <iframe title="Table 1: Suburbs Offer a Small Percentage of Their Seats to Hartford Open Choice Students " aria-label="Table" id="datawrapper-chart-Qrb7J" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Qrb7J/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="972"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();
          </script>

          <p>Table 1: Add your standalone caption here.</p>

          <p>A second option is to use the <a href="https://www.tablesgenerator.com/html_tables">Tables Generator HTML tool</a>. Go to File > Import or manually enter your table data, then Generate the HTML code, and paste it here, similar to this sample: </p>

          <style type="text/css">
