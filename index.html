          <h2>Introduction</h2>

          <p class="lead">Have you ever wondered about the challenges faced by students grappling with financial hurdles on their educational path? and what percentage of these students complete their associate's degree at 2-year colleges? </p> 
		
		<p>The content question we aim to address is this: “At each 2-year college (with at least 5 students who started), what percentage of Hartford Promise students who there, successfully completed with an associates degree?” It's a question that carries significant implications for our community partners, who are: The Hartford Promise Organization. HP is committed to providing high-quality education for students in Hartford. Their goal is to reduce the impact of luck on success by ensuring that every Promise scholar has access to essential resources. It is important to acknowledge that this data will be looked at by The Hartford Promise and then used to get a better understanding of what institutions their students will flourish at as individuals and as an academic. It is our pleasure to be working with such a heartfelt organization like Hartford Promise, that cares so much about their students and only wants what is best for them. As we further delve deeper into the analysis of the data, it is vital to define the term “HP students” as students facing high costs and potential financial challenges during their educational journey. In our research, we have identified variation in the performance of students under Hartford Promise at each school, indicating that students thrive in distinct programs unique to their institutions.</p>

          <h2>Findings</h2>
          <p>Let’s begin with the big picture. We examined a total of 254 students who were a part of HP.  While about half of those earned a 4-year bachelor’s degree, we focused on a subset of 108 students who enrolled in 2-year colleges, but we focused on 11 students who received an associates degree from the 2-year college.
Analyzing the data provided by HP and compiled by US CollegeScorecard. The data shows that Manchester Community College showcases the highest number of graduates at 10, surpassing Capital Community College with 7 graduates and Tunxis Community College with 1.
	There is a noticeable variance between the Hartford Promise (HP) and aggregate graduation percentages for each institution, which implies differing success rates among specific students. Manchester Community College stands out as the highest graduation rate at 21%. However, it is worth noting that the sample size Hartford Promise has provided us only includes a total of eleven students.

	<p> Figure 1 shows a stacked bar graph and depicts the raw counts of Hartford Promise students at 2-Year colleges. We decided to display our graph this way to show raw counts in our first graph to convey two main objectives. Firstly, we aimed to show the frequency of student enrolling at each school to differentiate them ranging from highest to lowest enrollments. We decided to organize the colleges in this manner because it provides a clear and easily understandable ranking, allowing for a quick identification of the institutions with the highest and lowest numbers of students enrolled from Hartford Promise. Secondly, this visualization provides important context for our data, that being a relatively small sample size. 
Graduation rates serve as indicators of a college's effectiveness in student success. Higher graduation rates signify that the institution effectively supports students and provides necessary resources, while lower graduation rates may indicate areas of deficiency. In addition, one that is optimistic towards those succeeding in these institutions could imply that higher graduation rates tend to produce more skilled and educated individuals, which could then positively impact the workforce and contribute to economic growth. This will then enhance the community’s economic health by producing a workforce of skilled labor. 
Overall, analyzing graduation rates allows colleges to identify areas for improvement and implement strategies to increase success rates. This could involve targeted support for students, financial aid programs and teaching methodologies. For Hartford Promise, this is pivotal data. Their ultimate goal is to provide aid to students with the end goal of facilitating a degree for that student. With the best interest of the students in mind, HP can and should direct students towards programs with higher graduation rates.

		<p> This graph visualizes the percentage of Hartford Promise students who achieved an associate’s degree out of the 2016 and 2017 cohorts. We chose to use a single stacked bar graph here to best visualize the subsection of students who earned a degree. This graph offers a visual representation of the success (or lack thereof) of students who enroll in 2-year programs. It is important to note that this sample size is rather small, and future analyses of the same metrics in different data sets will help to round out the understanding of where the expected percentage of students to graduate is.
The visualization illustrates the percentage of individuals who obtained an associates degree and later earned a bachelor's degree presents data from the comprehensive dataset. It displays the proportion of students who completed an associates degree and the percentage of those individuals who went on to attain both an associates and a bachelor's degree. This is important information for HP, as bachelor’s degrees are the benchmark barrier to entry for many high-paying jobs. Earning a bachelor’s degree not only shows success on the student’s part, but also shows that the processes at Hartford Promises are working, to an extent. For example, Manchester Community College would be a perfect example signifying the amount of students accomplishing their associates degree with success. Hence as depicted in graph 3, this visualization offers a straightforward visual representation of the numerical data, enhancing its ease of understanding. It is important to note that, while only 11 students earned associatiates degrees, one student earned two separate associates degrees, increasing the total to 12 associates degrees earned.

          <h2>Methods and Sources</h2>
          <p>Our data is drawn from a masked data file sourced from Hartford Promise. The data includes information on students from the 2016 and 2017 cohorts, meaning they began receiving tuition support from Hartford Promise in 2016 or 2017. Our data parameters required us to focus on the students in 2-year programs, a total of 108 students from the two cohorts. In order to ensure a usable sample size, we only included schools that met the minimum threshold requirement of 5 students, yielding us a study of three colleges. Using pivot tables and formulaic logic through google sheets, we were able to break down the broader dataset into the information required under our parameters.
	As discussed prior, low sample size is a major restriction of the data. Traditionally, a minimum of 30 values is required to deem a sample representative. Despite the small sample size, this data is aimed to provide insight into what the true trends are within Hartford Promise students at 2-year programs. In order to optimize the data, similar analyses must be undertaken with future cohorts in order to ascertain the true nature of the observable trends.
		  It is also important to point out that our only data source we used was the masked Hartford Promise data given to us by our community partners at Hartford Promise, so the data source must stay anonymous. Please reach out to Hartford Promise if you would like to gain more information about the data used.
